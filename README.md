Overview
-----------------------------------
The project implements automated testing and continuous
integration. It includes unit tests and integration
tests for BarnesAndNoble and Amazon packages.
Checkstyle is used for static analysis, and Jacoco
is used for reports on code coverage. This also includes
a GitHub Actions workflow to run on each push.

All workflows passed successfully, while also generating
and uploading Checkstyle and Jacoco reports.
